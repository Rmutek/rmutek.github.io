        <strong>Oy’ster</strong>
        <br>Oy’ster   is   a   social   network   for   individuals   who   love,   enjoy   and   are   enthusiastic   about   oysters.   Users   can   post reviews,   browse   restaurants,   find   oyster   specific   specials   and   receive   recommendations.      Restaurant   roulette   is a   feature   which   asks   the   user   for   several   parameters   and   then   matches   them   with   a   restaurant   and   a   specific oyster.   As   users   post   reviews   they   become   eligible   for   exclusive   events   and   special   offers.
        Oy’ster   was   built   using   Ruby   on   Rails   and   VueJS.   Oy’ster   was   created   to   share   and   track   oysters   enjoyed   over a   lifetime   for   those   who   like   to   live   life   on   the   half   shell.

        (Please   note   that   several   bugs   are   still   being   worked   out   and   I   am   happy   to   demo   the   application   locally   on   my laptop)</p>
